    --> Java - What is OOP?

    OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

    Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data,
    while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

    Advantages:

    1 - OOP is faster and easier to execute;
    2 - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs;
    3 - OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself",
    and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug;
    4 - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time;

    NOTE: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code.
    You should extract out the codes that are common for the application,
    and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it.

    --> Java - What are Classes and Objects?

    Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming.

    Look at the following illustration to see the difference between class and objects:

    {
        Class: Horti-fruit;
        Objects: Banana, Apple, Strawberries, Mango
    }

    So, a class is a template for objects, and an object is an instance of a class.
