            What is Java?
            Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.

            It is used for:

            1- Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
            2- Desktop applications
            3- Web applications

            6- Database connection
            And much, much more!

            Why Use Java?

            1- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
            2- It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
            3- It is easy to learn and simple to use
            4- It is open-source and free
            5- It is secure, fast and powerful

            Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and
            allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
            As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa
